12/3/23, 4:35 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye is a contact
12/3/23, 4:35 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: Hi Nikhil, 
Sushant here. Lets start at 5p.m
https://meet.google.com/gau-bszd-wso
12/3/23, 4:35 PM - Nikhil: Okay sir
12/5/23, 11:39 AM - Nikhil: Hello sir good morning
12/5/23, 11:40 AM - Nikhil: You said suneel sir will be reaching me, he still hasn't may I know ?
12/5/23, 11:43 AM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: Hi nikhil, he will reach out to you within a day or 2.
12/5/23, 11:44 AM - Nikhil: Okay, thank you sir
12/8/23, 2:52 AM - Nikhil: Sir actually the photos generated are 2048 × 2048 size but the cat is sized in a rectangle 303 × 511 those photos will not be fitted in the cat place,,, 

I am thinking that either calendar template needs to be changed or sunil sir already said that photos can be  generated with any size so either it will be placed exactly..
12/8/23, 2:53 AM - Nikhil: If there is any way to adjust, give me an idea I will try
12/8/23, 8:02 AM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: 1 method is to resize those 12 photos to the size you want... you can do it in windows photo editor or online website like birme.net
12/8/23, 8:05 AM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: Also that cat calender is very basic.. we just want to fit the images once for a good calender... you can use the cat calender for trying out the libraries but ultimately we want to use some calender with good design like the 2nd one sunil sent.. those are high resolution ones and you would be able to use 2048*2048 there <This message was edited>
12/8/23, 8:07 AM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: So if you have a basic code.. find a few good templates, try to fit the images in them using your code (only 1 month/page will be sufficent) and share the templates in the group where we will finalise
12/8/23, 8:08 AM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: For size you can also use cv2 resize method if your want to do it with code
12/8/23, 8:35 AM - Nikhil: Okay sir i will update you..
12/8/23, 2:53 PM - Nikhil: i reduced the size to cat size with PIL library but they are not lloking well if i reduce the size to that
12/8/23, 2:53 PM - Nikhil: <Media omitted>
12/8/23, 3:23 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: You would need to first crop to maintain aspect ratio
12/8/23, 3:23 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: And then resize
12/8/23, 3:24 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: But find some calender where we can use square images
12/8/23, 3:24 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: Also lets discuss this in grp
12/8/23, 3:24 PM - Nikhil: Yes sir would you be better idea
12/8/23, 3:24 PM - Nikhil: Okay sir
12/10/23, 12:55 PM - Nikhil: Hello sir
12/10/23, 12:56 PM - Nikhil: I have tried with mail you have given but, only like koren humans are only being generated
12/10/23, 2:45 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: Hn woh ek particularkoren idol par trained hai
12/10/23, 2:46 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: So expected hai
12/10/23, 2:52 PM - Nikhil: Sir, I don't understand Hindi 😅
12/10/23, 3:29 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: That id has been trained on a korean celebrity, so it is expected that is is generating photos of korean human <This message was edited>
12/10/23, 3:30 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: So you just have to assume that you will get 12 pictures lets say in folder and then your algorithm will add them to the calender and return a pdf
12/10/23, 3:50 PM - Nikhil: Sure sir, that work has been done
12/18/23, 10:19 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: null
12/18/23, 11:38 PM - Nikhil: sir i have created a env for Calender and tested it, it asked for Image.LANCZOS so i have chnaged and updated in the branch i have created and before pr is there so please check sir
12/18/23, 11:38 PM - Nikhil: now code is working fine
12/18/23, 11:42 PM - Nikhil: and for the image_cropper also creating and env and do it and cloning from the git hub <This message was edited>
12/18/23, 11:53 PM - Nikhil: i have cloned and created a branch named as nikhil
12/19/23, 11:41 AM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: Great
12/19/23, 8:01 PM - Nikhil: Hello sir
12/19/23, 8:01 PM - Nikhil: I have seen the code and setup in my laptop and executed it
12/19/23, 8:04 PM - Nikhil: And I have understood code but that aspect ratio logic is like bit confusing
12/19/23, 8:04 PM - Nikhil: Now next what I have to do in the next step
12/19/23, 8:27 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: Lets have a meet around 11?

12/22/23, 12:42 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: I pulled the code you committed in main branch.. it is working fine
12/22/23, 12:42 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: Not merging your pr yet as it would require to update the library version
12/22/23, 12:43 PM - Nikhil: Okay sir

12/22/23, 12:47 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: Also since you have added face detection and matching, lets start working on cropping next.. lets say image has 2 faces, you identified which face to crop.. but during cropping some portion of the other face also comes.. lets try to prevent this <This message was edited>
12/22/23, 12:48 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: You can start working on this, lets discuss everything in evening then
12/22/23, 12:48 PM - Nikhil: Sure sir 👍

12/28/23, 3:57 PM - Nikhil: Hi sir
12/28/23, 3:57 PM - Nikhil: can i try different model for face recognition,
12/28/23, 3:58 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: Sure
12/28/23, 3:59 PM - Nikhil: i will try sir
12/28/23, 4:00 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: Any major problems wuth mtcnn?
12/28/23, 4:00 PM - Nikhil: it is not detecting faces which are better also
12/28/23, 4:01 PM - Nikhil: so i face recognition only it is there to locate face and detect once i will try and update accordling
12/28/23, 4:39 PM - Nikhil: I have checked for mtcnn and face recognition model where 
For c1 - mtcnn - 6, face_recognition - 7

For c2 - mtcnn - 8, face_recognition - 9

For c1 - mtcnn - 8, face_recognition - 8
12/28/23, 4:39 PM - Nikhil: They detected face like this sir
12/28/23, 4:44 PM - Sushant Tech OdinEye: Sure you can specify an option which will allow to select different face detection model
